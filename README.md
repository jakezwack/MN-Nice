🤝 MN-Nice NeighborLink
Connecting the North Metro, One Driveway at a Time.
MN-Nice NeighborLink is a hyper-local service marketplace built for the residents of Coon Rapids, Anoka, and the surrounding North Metro area. This application bridges the gap between homeowners in need of reliable snow removal and local contractors—including the next generation of "Kid Next Door" entrepreneurs.

🚀 Vision
Transitioning from the emergency-only "SnowSOS" model, NeighborLink provides a secure, role-based platform that facilitates community help with professional accountability. Whether it's a heavy blizzard or a routine shovel, we ensure no neighbor is left snowed in.

✨ Key Features
Secure Authentication: Mandatory Google Sign-In via Firebase for community safety.

Dual-Role Ecosystem:

Homeowners: Post jobs with specific driveway dimensions and base offers.

Plow Drivers & Shovelers: A real-time job board to claim and manage local tasks.

Kid Next Door (KND) Mode: A specialized toggle for neighborhood youth to build their first service routes under adult supervision.

Live Mapping: Integrated Google Maps for precise geocoding of job sites and driver routing.

Fair Bidding: A transparent "Haggle Logic" allowing contractors to bid up to 20% over base offers for difficult terrain or deep snow.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Framework: Next.js (Frontend)

Backend: Firebase (Authentication, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Storage)

Deployment: Firebase App Hosting via GitHub

Mapping: Google Maps Platform API

📝 Usage & Payment
This app serves as a connection platform only. All payments and financial transactions are settled privately and directly between the homeowner and the service provider. MN-Nice NeighborLink does not process payments or take a commission from local workers.
